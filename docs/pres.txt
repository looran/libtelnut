=== Telnet usage in the wild

Mainly on embeded devices, but also on 'real' servers, many in telco and
banking.
* ADSL routers
* TV set-top boxes
* IP routers
* firewalls
* HLR...

But on embeded, sometimes it's the only shell access.

Many are running Linux, it's what we are targeting here
	mainly busybox based http://www.busybox.net/
Some others (Mikrotix RouterOS, Draytek DrayOS, ...)

=== Telnet background

TELNET: The Mother of All (Application) Protocols
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit/IEEE-L7-v2.html

=== Implementation

Slow sending, humanoid like
You do not always directly have a shell
	Execute commands
	Fingerprinting necessary
Binary push
	base64 shell/awk decoder integrated, to boostrap
	optionnal 2 steps decoding with native base64 decoder (faster)
Echo issue
	Most telnet servers do echo by default, so you will get back what you send
	Telnet protocol IAC DON'T ECHO option is ignored by many telnet servers
	Implementation of echo canceler, disabled for now, needs love

=== Cross compile

Using buildroot (recommended)

Using crossdev (gentoo)
